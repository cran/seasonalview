Under the hood:

- better way to pass stuff to shiny app, using shinyOptions().
- uses import.spc() from seasonal 1.4 for X-13 spc parsing.
- workaround functions to properly import xts, which depends on zoo functions, 
  so that seasonalview can be imported from other packages, such as seasonal. 
  This will be reworked once a new version of xts is on CRAN.

Bug fixes:

- Fixed issue that led to a crash when X-13 code was manipulated.
